# Flutter Architecture & Development Patterns

## Project Structure

This is a Flutter mobile app called "Juga en Equipo" with a clean architecture pattern. The main entry point is [main.dart](mdc:lib/main.dart) which sets up the app with Provider state management.

## Architecture Layers

- **Presentation Layer**: Located in `lib/presentation/` with screens, widgets, and business logic
- **Data Layer**: Located in `lib/datasources/` with API services, models, and use cases
- **Providers**: Located in `lib/providers/` for state management using Provider package
- **Router**: Located in `lib/router/` with [app_routes.dart](mdc:lib/router/app_routes.dart) defining navigation

## Key Patterns

1. **Provider Pattern**: Use ChangeNotifierProvider for state management
2. **Screen Structure**: Each screen has its own directory with business_logic, screens, and widgets subdirectories
3. **Navigation**: Use the centralized routing system in AppRoutes
4. **Theme**: Follow the theme system in [app_theme.dart](mdc:lib/theme/app_theme.dart) with consistent colors and styling
5. **Internationalization**: Support for EN, ES, and PT languages using l10n

## File Naming Conventions

- Use snake_case for file names
- Screen files end with `_screen.dart`
- Provider files end with `_provider.dart`
- Widget files end with descriptive names
- Model files end with `_model.dart`

## State Management

- Use Provider package for state management
- Create providers in the business_logic directory of each feature
- Register providers in [main.dart](mdc:lib/main.dart) MultiProvider setup

## Dependencies

Key packages used: provider, google_fonts, dio, flutter_screenutil, image_picker, shared_preferences
